# Project Title: Sales Quantity Forecasting for Pizza Dataset

## Project Overview & Objectives:

Dataset: pizza_data.xlxs

In this project, we will explore the pizza transaction dataset using various techniques, including many supervised learning algorithms (listed below).
The goal is to analyze and model total quantity sold by weekly of specific pizza w specific size in New Jersey based on different category features.
the result we want is the predicting total sales/ quantity for the next year by each pizza and sizes. We will do it by aggregating weekly predictions to get annual forecasts  

## Project Structure:
1. Exploratory data analysis, preprocessing and aata preparation.
2. Analysing the impact of different data transformations.
3. Analysing the impact of different models
4. Forecasting pizza demand (quantity & sales) using the best model.
5. Exploring sales and quantity trends with forecasted data
6. Interpret results

To predict the quantity sold based on categorical features, several prediction models can be considered. The choice of model depends on the nature of the data and the specific problem requirements. Here are some suitable models for handling categorical features:

1. Linear Models with Regularization:
Lasso Regression (L1 regularization): Helps in feature selection by shrinking less important feature coefficients to zero.
Ridge Regression (L2 regularization): Regularizes model complexity by shrinking coefficients without setting them to zero.
Advantages:
Good for datasets with many categorical variables, especially if one-hot encoding leads to a high-dimensional space.
Efficient and interpretable.

2. Decision Tree Regression:
Handles both numerical and categorical data natively.
Can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
Advantages:
Intuitive and easy to interpret.
No need for extensive preprocessing of categorical data.

3. Random Forest Regression:
An ensemble of decision trees, which improves generalization by reducing variance.
Handles categorical features well and is robust to overfitting.
Advantages:
High accuracy and can capture complex patterns.
Feature importance can be derived, providing insights into the impact of different features.

4. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM):
Handle categorical features effectively.
Advantages:
Excellent predictive performance.
Built-in handling for categorical features.

5. Support Vector Machines (SVM):
Can be used with kernels to capture non-linear relationships.
Requires preprocessing of categorical data into numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Advantages:
Effective for both linear and non-linear data.
Robust to overfitting in high-dimensional spaces.

## Outcome for the best model:

- The dataset was used in the model is the dataset after applying a log transformation to the target variable and standardizing the data

- Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) for regression is the bets model.

- The model setup is outlined below. For detailed information, please refer to the Jupyter notebook: 

Ensure to set the random generator's state to "5508" for reproducibility in splitting the data. Consider data2_W, using the 80%-20% splitting of the data into training and test sets, and ensure appropriate standardization (scaling the features). Perform 10-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance more reliably. Use GridSearchCV to fine-tune the regularization parameters, particularly the number of estimators (n_estimators) and learning rate. Consider a range such as [50, 100, 200] to test how the number of trees in the ensemble affects the model's performance (n_estimators). Consider values like [0.01, 0.05, 0.1] (learning_rate). A lower learning rate may require a larger number of estimators. Test the max_depth parameter of the individual decision trees within the ensemble, with a range such as [3, 15,1]. Test subsample = [0.8, 1.0] to use a fraction of the training set for each boosting iteration.

### More information about BGM model: 

Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) are powerful at capturing complex relationships and interactions within the data, even if they aren't explicitly defined. These models can learn patterns such as seasonality, consumer behavior trends, and feature interactions (like how week_of_year, price_category, and size interact to affect demand) without requiring external factors like weather or promotions.

Here's how GBM can capture these relationships:

- Handling Non-linear Relationships: GBM can model non-linear relationships. For instance, the relationship between the week of the year and the predicted quantity sold might not be linear, but GBM can capture these non-linear patterns through decision trees. It can identify the specific weeks where demand spikes and learn when and why these spikes occur.

- Interaction Between Features: GBM is great at capturing interactions between features. For example, it can learn how the combination of certain weeks and specific price categories influences predicted sales. If certain price points have a stronger effect on sales during certain weeks (like discounts around holidays), GBM can capture these interactions.

- Learning from Temporal or Cyclical Patterns: Although dataset doesn't directly include time series features like weather or promotions, GBM can still learn from patterns that emerge from the week_of_year or season columns. 

For example:

If certain types of pizzas (e.g., The Thai Chicken Pizza) are more popular in the summer, the model can learn this trend.

If demand for a pizza is generally higher in the week before holidays (e.g., week_of_year 51), the model will adapt to this.

- Feature Importance: GBM assigns importance scores to features based on how well they reduce errors during training. This means the model may give higher importance to features like week_of_year or season if they are strongly associated with variations in sales, allowing the model to use these patterns for predictions.

- Adaptive Learning: Gradient boosting works iteratively by adjusting predictions based on the errors made by previous trees. This allows the model to fine-tune its understanding of how certain weeks, sizes, or other factors influence the quantity sold over time. If the data shows certain seasonal effects or trends (like increased sales in certain weeks), the model will adapt to this and reflect it in the predictions.

## Outcome for sales & quantity forecasting:

2015 total sales: 817.86K

2015 total quantity: 49574

2016 Total Sales (predict): 766410.2264293174

2016 Quantity (predict): 46456.417408155285

Seems like predicted quantity in 2016 according to the predicting model has lower sales and lower quantity than 2015. For further understanding, we can plot total sales, quantity by month, week with the predicted quantity to find out the reasons.

## Insights and Recommendations Based on the Analysis

1. Best-Selling and Least-Selling Pizzas:
- 2015: The best-selling pizza was The Classic Deluxe Pizza, followed by The BBQ Chicken Pizza, The Hawaiian Pizza, and The Pepperoni Pizza.
- 2016 (Predicted): The Pepperoni Pizza is expected to be the top seller, followed by The Classic Deluxe Pizza, The California Chicken Pizza, and The Thai Chicken Pizza.
- Least-Selling Pizza (Both Years): The Brie Carre Pizza consistently ranks as the lowest seller (~500 units).
  
2. Size Preferences
- 2015 & 2016: Customers prefer sizes in this order: L > M > S > XL > XXL

3. Holiday vs. Non-Holiday Sales
- 2015: Non-holiday weeks sold 2.7 times more than holiday weeks.
- 2016 (Predicted): Non-holiday weeks are expected to sell 2.2 times more than holiday weeks.

4. Seasonal Trends
- 2015: Sales were highest in Summer > Spring > Winter > Fall
- 2016 (Predicted): Expected to shift to Winter > Spring > Fall > Summer.

5. Price Category Preferences
- Both Years: The majority of sales come from Medium-priced pizzas ($15-$25), followed by Low-priced (<$15), with High-priced (> $25) being almost negligible (~500 units).

6. Weekly Sales Trends
- 2015: Sales were stable (~900â€“1050 units) but saw drops in Weeks 39, 52, and 53.
- 2016 (Predicted): Follows a similar trend but starts higher (~700 units), with a gradual decline in the second half of the year and drops in Weeks 39, 52, and 53.

7. Feature Importance & Predictive Insights
- Price (18.8%) â€“ The strongest predictor, indicating that customers are highly price-sensitive.
- Week of Year (10.2%) â€“ Suggests clear seasonal and weekly sales patterns.

## Recommendation:
- Focus promotions on high-performing pizzas to drive even more sales.
- Promote the Brie Carre Pizza to assess customer demand. Since this pizza is currently available in only one size, analyze its sales performance after the promotion. If demand increases, consider introducing additional sizes or complementary offers. 
- Optimize inventory for Large and Medium pizzas since they are in high demand.
- Since 2016 predicts higher winter sales, consider launching winter-themed promotions (e.g., family bundles, seasonal flavors).
- Identify why summer sales are predicted to declineâ€”adjust marketing efforts accordingly.
- Focus product strategy on the medium-priced segment, which performs best.
- Consider revising pricing strategy for high-priced pizzasâ€”perhaps premium toppings or meal combos could justify the price.
- Weeks 39, 52, and 53 historically see sales dropsâ€”consider targeted marketing campaigns or discounts during these weeks to maintain volume.
- Monitor week-over-week performance closely to adjust inventory and promotions dynamically.
